## Database Setup

Make sure you have `docker-compose` installed!

1. Go into the server folder and start the docker-compose

```zsh
docker-compose up
```

2. (Optionally) Open the brower on `localhost:5050` and login using the PGADMIN email and password.

4. Start the server, and it should successfully connect to the database. Enjoy!
